        <h3 id="notitia">Notitia</h3>
        <p>Notitia is an app that was built in a team of 3 people using Git version control. We developed this app in which users are able to post about topics and/or subjects they are interested in teaching or learning from others.</p>
        <p> They would create a post with certain specifications and you can leave a review, and to find a specific post, we used AngularJS filtering systems (which we built on) to filter posts by a date range, radius or Post type (teaching or learning).</p>
        <p>For this project I built out the majority of the back end with Node.JS, focusing on the routes, CRUD, authentication, models, utilising MongoDB. Building these foundations allowed the team to focus on the design of the app, also complex and key functionality using the Google Maps API. I also worked on the functionality of the filtering system.</p>

        <h3>ANAGRAM FALLS</h3>
        <p>Anagram Falls was my first project that I had ever worked on, the end goal was to create a game using JavaScript ES6, HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>I wanted to involve a problem solving aspect to my game, which is why the game was based around anagrams, I like to think of as quick problems to solve.</p>
        <p> The game was a simple idea, where anagrams would fall from top to bottom and you would have to solve them before they reached the bottom, losing a life when they did.The higher the difficuluty chosen the faster they would fall and the more you would have to solve to beat the round.

        <p> Justo was a group project, it is an app that was built in a team of 4 people, using Git version control.We developed this app in which users could sign up as either developer looking for work, or business owners looking for developers. </p>

        <p>Business owners could post projects they wanted to be done with a budget, tech stack and deadlines, and developers could bid on these projects so the business owner could go with a cheaper bid and check out the developer's profile where others would have written reviews.</p>

        <p>We implemented in an in-app messaging system for all users to communicate within. (no gem used for this)</p>

        <p>For this project I spent the majority of the time working on the front end utilising AngularJS to provide the many views involved for users and getting all the data that was needed through to the view from the controllers and setting up the routes on the front end.</p>
